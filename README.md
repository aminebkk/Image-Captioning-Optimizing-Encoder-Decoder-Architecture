Embark on the captivating journey of Image Captioning with a sophisticated architecture that combines a powerful CNN-based encoder with a versatile RNN/LSTM/Transformer decoder. Delve into the realm of optimization techniques, from fine-tuning hyperparameters to implementing effective strategies for managing overfitting and underfitting, and experimenting with a diverse range of optimizers. Evaluate the efficacy of your model using the BLEU score metric on the expansive Flickr8k dataset, which serves as the training and validation bedrock. For a comprehensive assessment, a separate test set containing meticulously annotated captions is provided. Stay tuned for forthcoming instructions and guidelines as you embark on this thrilling project.
